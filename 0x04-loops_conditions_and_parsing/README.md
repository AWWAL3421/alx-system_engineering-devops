SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used for secure authentication and communication between two computers over a network. The pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is kept on the client-side and should be kept secret, while the public key is placed on the server-side to allow secure access.

When you connect to a remote server using SSH, the server checks if your client has the corresponding private key. If the private key matches the public key stored on the server, the authentication is successful, and you are granted access.
